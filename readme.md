### Patreon Corners

Inspired by Tim Holman's [GitHub Corners](http://tholman.com/github-corners/) and my own personal needs, Patreon Corners aims to bring that same stylish look to Patreon buttons as well.

You can build your own with the [SVGs](https://github.com/steven-kraft/patreon-corners/tree/master/svg), copy some of the pre-defined code, or just change the `fill` and `color` values on the main `<svg>` element.
